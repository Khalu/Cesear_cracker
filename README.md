# Cesear_cracker
This program takes a Cesearian ciphered [Wikipedia link about Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) string by calculating the shift by analyzing the letter frequency of the cipher text and comparing the hi . 

### Planned Improvements:
- validate the shift based on multiple letter frequencies 
- check for digraphs and trigraphs 
- crack for additional ciphers
